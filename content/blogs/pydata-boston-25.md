I had an opportunity to present at PyData Boston 2025 about analyzing the JupyterLab extension ecosystem.

The talk analyzes the current state of the JupyterLab extension landscape in 2025 using public PyPI (via BigQuery) and GitHub data to quantify growth, momentum, and health by examining metrics such as monthly downloads by category, release recency, the relationship between stars and downloads, and the emergence of AI-focused extensions.
