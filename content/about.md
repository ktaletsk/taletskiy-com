I'm a Senior Software Engineer at Anaconda, where I contribute to open source Jupyter projects and develop extensions that enhance the Jupyter ecosystem. With over 7 years of experience in software development, I specialize in interactive notebook environments, AI-powered developer tools, and scalable backend solutions. My background spans JupyterLab extensions, cloud architecture, and prompt engineering for AI applications.

Throughout my career, I've led development teams, created developer productivity tools, and built platforms that enable data scientists to collaborate effectively. At Anaconda, I'm focused on advancing the Jupyter ecosystem through contributions to JupyterLab and developing key extensions like gator and jupyter-fsspec.

I'm passionate about open source, solving complex technical challenges, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with modern technology. Feel free to connect if you'd like to discuss Jupyter, open source collaboration, or technical innovation!
